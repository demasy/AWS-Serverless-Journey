# AWS Serverless Journey
**Serverless**: Run code without thinking about servers. Pay only for the compute time you consume.

## AWS Lambda
Run code without thinking about servers or clusters

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.
